### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**GrishinSergey/GrishinSergey** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Sergey and I'm Android developer at ZimaOffice Danmark ApS. In my work I'm using Kotlin language for creating cool applications and have fun with it))
In a free time I'm learning new stuff like backend and game dev, so I'm trying different technologies like C#, Java, Scala, C++.
